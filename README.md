# Neural-Machine-Translator

This project is part of the Machine Learning class I took in the spring semester. In this built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline accepts English text as input and return the French translation. For this project, I designed the vanilla RNN without using tensorflow or keras. Then developed simple rnn and biderectional rnn to overcome the problem with simple rnn that they cant see the future inputs. These two models were developed using keras and tensorflow. Also, I implemented the word embedding for this project.
